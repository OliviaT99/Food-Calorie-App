(node:77784) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/oliviat/Documents/Uni/WS25_26/DBSM/Project/evaluation/audio/evaluateVoiceWithCharts.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/oliviat/Documents/Uni/WS25_26/DBSM/Project/package.json.
